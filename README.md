CS370 Final Project for team Global United
## Team Members

## How To Use
Our program uses a command line interface. To access the CLI features, the user has to navigate to the code directory where the cli_example.py file is located. The user can then run the following prompt in the command line to view all of the possible commands in the sound archive.
```
python cli_example.py -h
```
or
```
python3 cli_example.py -h
```
## Testing

## Challenges
One of the biggest challenges we have overcome was the implementation of the play_sounds_at_once function.
