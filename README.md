# GlobalUnited
CS370 Final Project for team Global United
## Team Members
- Fabian: Contributed to sound_player, testing and share_file module.
  
- Shahrom: Contributed to refactoring of code, adding features such as exporting in share_file.py and several file manager features. On top of that, I contributed to gui.py and player.py modules by adding features such as play options, export sounds and also have made changes to the design of the Player Controls component to ensure it renders correctly and integrates well with the overall design of the rest of the components.
  
- Terence: Contributed to gui.py and tools.py.
  
- Zurain: For Epoch 2 I developed the grouping sounds feature. That feature allows users to select which sounds in a library they want to group together and then add to a new folder which they can rename. These folders are basically playlists with names that can be edited. I also contributed to developing a simple UI that runs in the terminal. For Epoch 3, I developed the record audio feature which allows users to record audio files, and when they click on stop audio, the gui.py converts the audio file to .wav format and then saves the file in the sounds folder. I also contributed to the internal documentation for some of the files of the project.

## How To Use
Our program uses a graphical user interface built using the tkinter and customtkinter libraries. To run the application all the source files need to be in the same directory as the sounds folder, which will work as the main audio library. Once everything is in the same directory run the following commands: 

``
pip install -r requirements.txt
``
``
python3 gui.py
