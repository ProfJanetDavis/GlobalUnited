## How To Use
Our program uses a graphical user interface built using the tkinter and customtkinter libraries. To run the application all the source files need to be in the same directory as the sounds folder, which will work as the main audio library. Once everything is in the same directory run the following commands: 

``
pip install -r requirements.txt
``
``
python3 gui.py
